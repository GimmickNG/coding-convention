# coding-convention
The coding convention used across most of my repositories. Note that, above all else, exercise common sense when using this convention. If something doesn't seem right, don't force it to fit the convention; suggest the convention be changed to fit the case, as this isn't a convention that's set in stone.

See CodeConvention.as for an example of the convention used, with explanations.
